## Design Update
* We introduced new resources for the player, which are minor gems. These are  dispersed across the map as well as protected by ghosts. They provide additional health.
* Ghosts now have designated areas in which they are patrolling. There are 7 areas that have at least one ghost. This indicates more ghosts as well as more waypoints that ghosts use to patrol. 
* There is an additional way to collect ammunition outside of destroyed ghosts. These are also dispersed across the map as well as protected by ghosts. 
## UI Design
* We have included a new way to visualize health and the amount of ammunition you have left. This is indicated by bars and colors change when you change the amount of health/ammunition you have. 
* We have included a way to visualize weapon selection as well as how to use it. They are located in the lower left side of the screen for easy viewing access. 
* There is an end screen to indicate the result of the gameplay. 
## Sound Design 
* We have included different pieces of background music to navigate throughout the map. This includes a thunderstorm, ambient haunted house music, the boss level, as well as end screen music. 
* Amy, our main character, has reactions to events that happen throughout the game. This primarily includes collecting items, and getting hurt by ghosts. You are also able to hear Amy's movements throughout the map. 
* There are also sounds when those items are collected to provide feedback on collision.
